<em>The 25th Annual EVVY Awards</em> is the largest student-produced award show in the country. Modeled after the <em>Oscars</em> and the <em>Emmys</em>,
the show is a live switched eight-camera production, broadcast over
Boston Neighborhood Network (BNN), via satellite in New York and Los
Angeles, and webcast live from the <a href="http://maj.org/">Cutler-Majestic Theatre</a> in Boston.
<p>Originally created to recognize student achievement in television, <em>The EVVY Awards</em> has evolved to include nearly every area of study offered at <a href="http://www.emerson.edu/">Emerson College</a>,
awarding the best in Emerson television, video, film, performance,
photography, audio, new media, marketing, and writing. Winners and
nominees are decided by working professionals recruited by <em>The EVVY Awards</em>.</p>
<p><em>The EVVY Awards</em> was founded in 1981 by <a href="http://eivtv.com/">Emerson Independent Video</a> students Glenn Meehan and Martie Cook and celebrates its silver anniversary on May 13, 2006.</p>

<p class="title">Dispute</p>
<p class="plain"><span class="emph">Well</span>, here's the problem.  Yours truly, Zachary "Tater" Hunter, went scrounging around his
computer to find any decent picture of me and my love, Lockie "Puddin" Montgomery, to put up on our new
website.  </p>
<p class="plain"><span class="emph">After</span> hours and hours of grueling work, I did finally find a respectable image which I,
for my part, thought was extreamly cute.  It was a shot taken by a friendly, though extreamly laid-back
(read slow) cab driver in Atlanta.  Granted, it wasn't the first picture I would have chosen to display
to the world on our website, but I did already have in in an electonic format that made it redily postable.
And, after all, I was trying to suprise my fianc&eacute; with this wonderful gift.</p>
<p class="plain"><span class="emph">So</span>, long story short, upon viewing the image, Puddin shot off a nasty email to your humble
narator demanding that I remove the picutre as it was somewhat unflattering in it's portrayal of said sender.
Now, I ask you, humble reader, does that sound fair?  I believe that any picture is better than no picture.
My intended believes showing nothing is better than showing crap.  What do you think?  <a href="pic1.html">Here is the picture</a></p>
<form name="picSurvey"">
<table class="plain" border="1" width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="center"><div class="emph">Keep the Picture</div><br><input type="button" value="It's Wonderful" onClick="document.location.href = '/cgi-bin/sendYes.pl'"></td>
<td align="center"><div class="emph">Toss the Picture</div><br><input type="button" value="It's Crap" onClick="document.location.href = '/cgi-bin/sendNo.pl'"></td>
</tr>

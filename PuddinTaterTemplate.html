<p class="subtitle">A New Addition on the Way</p>
<p class="plain">Well, in case you haven't heard, Puddin's preggers.  That's right, against all better judgement, we've decided
to make a little copy of ourselves.  If everything goes as planned, we'll add a 3<sup>rd</sup> Hunter to the clan sometime in 
late October or early November.  The doctors have named November 2 as the official date.  But, as you all probably know, they
don't know squat.</p>

<p class="plain">We've been working frantically to improve ourselves and our surroundings to accomodate the little tike.  
In that vein, we recently completed a birthing and childcare class.  We even got a certificate with a gold start, so we must
be ready, right?</p>


<p class="plain">As you can see, Puddin has been doing her part to make a cozy home for LBL (Little Blue Line - after our first 
indication of his/her existance).  After a marathon bout of morning (more aptly named all-day) sickness, she's been holding up
incredibly well.  There's no way she'd be slowed by a little thing like another person growing inside her.</p>

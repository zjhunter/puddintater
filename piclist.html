<p class="title">Pictures</p>
<p class="plain"><span class="emph">Here</span> are a list of some cute pictures to look at.
For the time being, they're just the picture.  I haven't the time to make nice schnazzy border/display
pages for them.  I do have a bunch going on.  Please bare with me. ;)</p>
<p class="plain">PS: Most of the images are pretty big (~350K) so if you're on a dial-up connection,
they may take a while to load.  Be warned.</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Here's a picture of my bride to be and her Donn-of-honer.  <a href="images/donnamarie1.jpg">pic</a>
<li>This is Lockie's, and soon to be my, nephew Bishop. <a href="BishopPic.html">pic</a>
<li>Here's Lockie, Zac, Donna and Greg (Donna's hubby) outside on Shelter Island for
New Year's. <a href="images/NYGroup1.jpg">pic</a>
<li>Here we are outside.  Just a little chilly, I'd guess. <a href="images/NYGroup2.jpg">pic</a>
<li>This is a shot of me (Zac) with my future Mother-in-Law, Martha.  Something's gone a little fowl in
the kitchen <a href="images/zacmom.jpg">pic</a> <br><font size="-1">(I can't help it, it's hereditary)</font>
<li>Finally, a smoocharoo from the bride and groom on our way back from Savanah. <a href="images/thekiss.jpg">pic</a>

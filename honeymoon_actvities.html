<div class="emph">Eating</div>
New Orleans is all about the food.  From old standards like the Commander's Palace to the newcomers like Emeril's, one can find a great meal on every corner.
We tried a balanced diet of old and new. We had the ubiquitous turtle soup at Commanders as well as their signature dessert, bananas foster.  
<span class="asside">(Lockie's eyes glaze over when anyone mentions <span style="font-style: italic;">Foster</span>. It brings her to her happy place).</span>
</p>
<p class="plain">
At Commanders we were surrounded by staff.  One unfortunate waiter had the task of picking up our dropped napkins.  
He replaced our napkins a record of 273 times!  We were also seen at Emeril's (photo at left).  Unfortunately Emeril himself was not seen, he was also honeymooning
with wife #2, 3?
</p>
<p class="plain">So, we have had the great food, from beignets to Gumbo, But how to create these New Orleans masterpieces of culinary perfection at home?  We took a cooking class. 
links to all above mentioned fun stuff, just click.

<div class="emph">Bowling</div>
Nothing like a cultural experience.  What could be more newlywed than bowling a few sets?

On a hot day in the bayou, you've got to find a way to get out of the sun.
Who ever thought that you'd try to strike out on you own honeymoon.  As it turns out, it wasn't even possible.

<p class="title">Lockie Marie Hunter
<br>(Puddin)</p>
<p class="subtitle">(aka Lockie Montgomery or Marie Montgomery)<br>a brief geographical history</p>
<p class="plain">

To know me is to know my geography. The places I have lived have shaped who
I am.
</p>
<p class="plain">
A transplanted hillbilly, Lockie was born in the hills of Tennessee in the
60's&mdash;the LATE 60's, mind you. She moved to Massachusetts and attended
Hanover Junior High and <a href="http://www.hanoverhigh.org/">Hanover High School</a> in the 70s-80s. Since she had
never lived outside of Tennessee her accent was not a very New
England-friendly one.  She spent the first year or so just trying to
understand the natives. Additionally, they asked such questions of her as,
"Do you know Gomer Pyle personally?"  It was enlightening for all. Junior
High being very educational and formative years (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.judyblume.com/menu-main.html">Judy Bloom</a> books,
<a href="http://www.bonnebell.com/wos/">Bonne Bell</a>
strawberry lip smack gloss, and grape scented stationary adding greatly
to Lockie's personal growth), she matured into a fine young adult. The time
when, at 14 years of age, she held her breath until she turned blue because
she was denied going to the Cape with the high school seniors was not her
proudest moment. Nevertheless, Incidents like this were rare, or at least
they have been expunged from the collective family memory/database.
</p>
<p class="plain">
As she was finally learning how to spell Massachusetts correctly,  Lockie
moved again in the early 80's to finish her high school in Tennessee.  Now
firmly Yankeefied, her hometown Tennessee friends could not understand a
word she uttered. She attended <a href="http://www.dobyns-bennett.com/">Dobyns-Bennett High School</a>. Aside form the
'running over the driver's ed teacher's foot incident', the remainder of her
high school years passed relatively peacefully.

<a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a>, (Go Tigers!) in South Carolina was her University of
choice.  Might as well stay in the south&mdash;let's not change accents again. It
was here that she met <A HREF="http://www.puddintater.com/donna.html">Donnadonnadonna</A>.  <a href="notyet.html">Click here</a> for college
photos-warning big hair!!!  Clemson was a wonderful time.  Since Clemson was
a land grant agricultural college, Lockie gained a secondary education in
plants.  She even had neighbors majoring in 'dirt'. Often plants and trees
were labeled around campus.  The first time Lockie saw a label for -Water
Oak- she thought it a note for the gardener to mist the tree. The grounds of
the university were always blooming. Clemson has tons o' Magnolias (see pic at right) and the
lockiedonna combo loved to pluck them from trees. Not everyone appreciated
Clemson.  Some called it MOO U due to its ties with agriculture. Zac
attended University of Chicago and has choice words about Clemson. Click here
for Zac's bad Clemson joke. :(
</p>
<p class="plain">
Lockie graduated Clemson in 1990 and headed straight to San Francisco where
she lived through most of the 90's. Homesick, lacking seasons, and noting
absence of fireflies, Lockie found herself back on the east coast in the late
90's. She met Zac in Atlanta (blind date) and settled down in Boston.
Lockie developed a taste for urban life while in S.F.&mdash;this is the proper
nickname for the city. Don't call it Frisco. (<span class="asside">An aside re: urbanity. We just
had a new corner convenience store move in across the street from our
Brownstone. Thank God, as we were quite exhausted from walking the requisite
block to the closest store.</span>) After living in Baghdad by the Bay&mdash;another
acceptable SF nickname perhaps coined by columnist <A target="_blank" HREF="http://www.sfgate.com/columnists/caen/caenobit.shtml">Herb Cain</A>&mdash;Lockie was
sushi spoiled&mdash;that is to say she needed to live in a setting with a variety
of ethnic backgrounds and the accompanying food, cultures, music etc. Boston
fit the bill and had <span class="emph">snow</span>&mdash;BONUS!  We should note that Zac was working in the
Hub&mdash;acceptable nickname for Boston&mdash;don't call it Beantown&mdash;and asked Lockie
to move up for the WINTER! (Isn't one supposed to move south for the
winter?) In the winter, Boston has a serious Magnolia shortage.
Zac had been living in California, the American South and New England as
well, and we joke that we were chasing one another around the country in a
triangular pattern until we found each another.
Since living in Boston Lockie has become a <a href="puddin_yoga.html">yoga girl</a>.
</p>

<p class="plain">In 2002 Lockie gave birth to a beautiful, vocal daughter, <A HREF="http://www.puddintater.com/pascale.html">Pascale Sligh Hunter</A>.  In 2004 she gave birth to a cute, giggly son, <A HREF="http://www.puddintater.com/graham.html">Graham Sargent Hunter</A>.  They have inspired her work and her life in countless ways.  Now that Lockie and Zac have replaced themselves on the planet, they are done with reproducing any more humans.</p>
<p class="plain">In this new millennium, Lockie is currently on sabbatical from the real world while she attends Boston's <A target="_blank" HREF="http://www.emerson.edu/">Emerson College</A> where she is earning her <A target="_blank" HREF="http://www.emerson.edu/writing_lit_publishing">MFA in creative writing</A>.  Lockie calls this retirement, but Zac insists that it is just a sabbatical and that she begin gainful employment at 8 a.m. on Tuesday May 15th of 2007&mdash;commencement for her master's degree being on Monday May 14th of 2007. </p>

<p class="plain">Her fiction and essays have been published in various publications including
 The Morning News, Opium, Chick Flicks, MadLovin Mama, Southern Hum, Seattle Writergrrls, The Emerson Review, Muscadine Lines; a Southern Journal, ken*again, the literary magazine, Wild Violet, Literary Mama, and Foliate Oak.</p>

<p class="plain">She has won an EVVY award for best prose.</p>

<p class="plain">Lockie also writes a humor column for Mad Hatter Review titled "Lockie Confidentials."</p>

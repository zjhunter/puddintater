<p class="plain"><span class="emph">Can you believe it?</span>  Lockie's been perfecting the art of saluting the sun.  And, she's really taken to it.
She's got 3 classes a week ranging from gentle spiritual yoga (closer to psychotherapy than exercise) to mega Ashtanga yoga where she practices becoming
a human pretzle for 90 minutes.
</p>
<p class="plain">
She's taking these at <a href="http://www.bostonsportsclub.com">Boston Sports Club</a> and will soon become the yoga champion of the world.
(She's already secured the Hunter household title and is a favorite for the Mass. Ave crown).

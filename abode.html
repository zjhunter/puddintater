	So, we live in Boston.  Beantown.  The birthplace of the nation.  
	Okay, so that's supposed to be Philly, but you all know the deal.</p>
	
	<p class="plain">Since moving here in the fall of 1999, Lockie and I have learned a lot about our new home town.
	We both lived near here in our past <span class="asside">(I, in Rowley and then Haverhill - Lockie, in Hanover)</span>,
	but not only have we changed since then, Boston has as well.  In spades.</p>
	
	<p class="plain">To re-acclimate ourselves, Lockie did some research on the subject.  We've discovered many things
	perhaps, the most important are the <a href="boston_driving.html">driving rules</a>.  It ain't exactly a congeniality
	contest on the roads up here.</p>
	
	<p class="">Another unique fact of living in Boston (the Hub) is the <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/local/02118">weather</a>. 
	We have had occasion to experience many odd weather patterns.  <span class="asside">&quot;It's New England, if you don't like the weather, 
	wait five minutes.&quot;</span> We were hailed upon in July at an outdoor Boston Pops concert, soaring temps in the 90's this 
	year broke records in the spring.  A record low was set just three days later.  And of course, there is always one 
	last snowfall in May.  We made a beeline to the <a href="http://www.llbean.com">L.L.Bean</a> factory warehouse 
	to stock up on winter gear. </p>

	We live in a turn-of-the-century brownstone in Boston's historic <a href="http://www.panoramamagazine.com/articles/goingsouth.htm">South End</a>.
	The South End contains the largest number of Victorian bow-front row houses in the United States. 
	<span class="asside">(To see an architectural diagram of a typical brown stone, <a href="images/abode/landmarks-facade1.gif">click here</a>.)</span>
	It is a neighborhood of marked cultural diversity.  It is also noted for it's art community, stunning architecture, and great restaurants.

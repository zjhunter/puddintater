<p class="plain">Thank you for your vote.  I fully support your right to voice your own opinion...
regardless of how incorrect, and without basis in fact or good taste it may be.  So far, there have been
<img src="/cgi-bin/Counter/counter.cgi?page=crap&add=yes"> votes cast in agreement with you.  Heaven knows

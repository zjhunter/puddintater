<p class="plain">
Born September 20, 19.. 
<span class="asside">(discretion is the better part of valor)</span>
she in turn gave birth to <a href="notyet.html">Kimberly Gwyn Hunter</a> and 
<a href="tater.html">Zachary Jay Hunter</a> <span class="asside">(of puddintater.com fame)</span> and
is celebrating the publishing of her first book 
<a href="http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cornellpress/cup3_catalog.taf?_function=detail&Title_ID=3546">PURCHASING IDENTITY IN THE ATLANTIC WORLD:
<span style="font-size : smaller;">Massachusetts Merchants, 1670-1780</span></a>,  
a scholarly work about the birth of American capitalism and transatlantic trade in early colonial New England.
Before we get to that, however, let's start at the beginning.  </p>
<p class="plain">
Phyllis grew up in Allentown, PA spending much time figure skating and playing the cello, a gift
with which her mother <a href="notyet.html">Dorothy Whitman</a> was greatly blessed.  She then
attended and Graduated from <a href="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a> with degree in American History.  While in 
Cambridge she met a handsome devil named <a href="notyet.html">Thomas Oakford Hunter</a>
<span class="asside">(tater's pop)</span> whom she married at historic <a href="http://www.oldnorth.com">Old North Church</a> 
in Boston, MA.  Unfortunately, as fate would have it, they split up and Phyllis moved on to become
<ul>
<li>Sales Manager for a natural foods &amp; personal care product manufacturer</li>
<li>Waitress at a hotel restuarant</li>
<li>Stockbroker</li>
<li>Founder, owner and president of her own financial planning company</li>
<li>Graduate Student</li>
</ul>
It was that last one that really stuck.  After earning a Masters degree from the 
<a href="http://www.usf.edu">University of South Florida</a> she went on to claim a Ph.D. in 
American Studies from <a href="http://www.wm.edu">William &amp; Mary University</a>.
</p>
<p class="plain">Phyllis is currently teaching at the <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/home.html">University of 
North Carolina, Greensboro</a> and, as previously mentioned, just published her first book at the
University of Cornell press.  Needless to say, we are all exteremly proud of her.  She's currently 
beginning work on her next book tentatively focusing on the imaging of "The East" in early colonial
America.  If you want to know what that means, you'll have to ask her.  ;)
</p>
<p class="plain">Keep an eye on this page as we might soon have some samplings of both Phyllis's writing
and her individually styled watercolor "homages" of the world's great artwork.</p>

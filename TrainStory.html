<p class="title">Train Story</p>
<p class="subtitle">An adventure on the SNCF <br>(the French rail service)</p>
<!-- Content Table (to keep nav clear) -->
<p class="storytext">
<span class="firstletter">O</span><span class="firstline">ne of our biggest adventures</span> centers around trying to leave Paris for the
southern city of Avignon.
We arrived during the TGV train strike.  The TGV is "Trans Grand
Vitesse"-the pride of France. The strike affected all trains leaving
Paris-the TGV was our only planned transportation to Avignon!  We had not

rented a car in Paris, but had one awaiting us in Provence. Why rent a car
in the city? It would be an 8 hour drive-it's only a 4 hour train ride. We
certainly could not take a cab!  
</p>
<p class="storytext">
We were told that the strike would surely be over by our departure date of Saturday. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">
Well....We tried to buy tickets
on the preceding Friday. The ticket machine stated in French what we thought
was "your card has been denied by the Central Banking Authority". odd.  So
we approached a ticket window, and noticed that each window had
"adjourd-hui" flashing in red neon above them.  We found someone that spoke
enough English who explained that the strike was still in full force, and we
could not buy tickets for Saturday's train at this time. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">
So much for pre-planning.
</p>
<p class="storytext">
Saturday we awake extra early and haul all of our luggage and
goodies bought in Paris down to the Train Station.  (My luggage at this
point weighs a <span class="emph">ton</span>.) The train station is in a state of chaos!  People
screaming at attendants in red jackets, dogs everywhere, luggage abandoned.
</p>
<p class="storytext">
Unreal.
</p>
<p class="storytext">Zac waits in line for 2 1/2 hours while I watch the luggage.
Several times things almost came to fisticuffs when a sneaky Parisian would
try to cut in line. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">Tempers are high.
</p>
<p class="storytext">We now have a 2:00 ticket for Nice,
then we wait in Nice for another train to Avignon. First class -<span class="comment">paid a
fortune</span>- but first class was the only guarantee that we would have a seat.
</p>
<p class="storytext">
We check the big monitor board which is flipping like mad trying to stay
current with the changes.  No 2:00 to Nice. we wait. Still no mention of a
2:00 to Nice. Zac investigates. Apparently there is no 2:00 train to Nice!
But we just bought these tickets an hour ago! A quote from attendant in red
jacket - "eh!" accompanied by a shoulder shrug. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">So we ask another red jacket,
and he explains that due to strike any ticket is good for any train going
anywhere. Zac asked about our reserved seats. Another "Eh!"   
</p>
<p class="storytext">We see a 3:00
train going to Nice, and we plan to board it. Then I see all these people
sticking their tickets in a little yellow punch machine.  What is this?  Zac
goes to investigate. 
</p>
<p class="storytext"> Apparently, if we do not stick our tickets in the
little yellow punch machine we are not "validated" and can be fined 1000.00
francs on the spot. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">We punch our tickets. While punching we consult another
red jacket. This one speaks excellent English and tells us "Listen, there is
a 2:30 train leaving very soon directly for Avignon, I suggest you get on
it." Now we inch our way toward the quais so we can prepare to board when
the exact quai is announced.  
</p>
<p class="storytext">The French travel with their dogs like the
Americans travel with our computers. They are everywhere. One suspicious
poodle looks as if we wishes to pee on my luggage. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">We inch closer to the
quais.  All eyes are on the monitor. We wait. 10 minutes pass. We clutch our
luggage ready for action. The monitor flips into action and the 2:30 Avignon
train shows quai 3. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">It was like a scene out of Ghandi- people trampling one
another, luggage shoving, dogs yapping, kids screaming, mad rush to board.
Zac lost me in the crowd. He is screaming "Lockie!!, but I can not see him.
I finally spot him throwing our suitcases on the train. People are literally
tossing things over his head. such as small poodles. <span class="comment">yip!</span> I hand him my big
suitcase while elbowing an aggressive old lady out of my way. I bought an
umbrella in Paris with a mother of Pearl duck carve into the handle and I am
prepared to use it!  
</p>
<p class="storytext">We miraculously find seats.. and yes in first class.
People are arriving who actually have real tickets for this actual train and
are kicking people out of their first class seats.  "I am not going
anywhere", I tell Zac.  "Pretend like we belong", and I take a nail file
from my purse, and a copy of "La Maison". If they try to kick me out I am
prepared to stand my ground for these seats. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">Zac thinks I'm nuts, and goes
to find a conductor. There are none, and no porters. The strike. So it is a

free-for-all. No dispute resolution by authorities. Noone can make me leave.
I am staying put. We stay in these seats all the way to Avignon!! 
</p>
<p class="storytext">Now the
interior of the train resembles the train scene on Doctor Javago. People in
the aisles, playing cards, opening wine, students smoking and standing in
the connectors between cars. 
</p>
<p class="storytext">
Hilarious! 
</p>
<p class="storytext">
We arrive in Avignon exhausted and achy from our luggage, and the worlds
cutest bellhop grabs everything and shows us to our huge antiqued, airy,
room with marble bath, bidet and Jacuzzi tub! Lockie is tress hereuxe!!!

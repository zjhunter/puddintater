<p class="subtitle">A New Addition on the Way</p>


<p class="plain">Well, in case you haven't heard, Puddin's preggers.  That's right, against all better judgement, we've decided
to make a little copy of ourselves.  If everything goes as planned, we'll add a 3<sup>rd</sup> Hunter to the clan sometime in 
late October or early November.  The doctors have named November 2 as the official date.  But, as you all probably know, they
don't know squat.</p>

<p class="plain">We've been working frantically to improve ourselves and our surroundings to accommodate the little tike.  
In that vein, we recently completed a birthing and child care class.  We even got a certificate with a gold start, so we must
be ready, right?</p>


<p class="plain">As you can see, Puddin has been doing her part to make a cozy home for LBL (Little Blue Line - after our first 
indication of his/her existance).  After a marathon bout of morning (more aptly named all-day) sickness, she's been holding up
incredibly well.  There's no way she'd be slowed by a little thing like another person growing inside her.</p>


<p class="plain">Now, for most of you out there who have at least a rudimentary understanding of the human reproductive process, 
you know that for these past 9 months, there hasn't been much that Tater can add to the process.  Pretty much, his role has been
to perform the mundane duties that Puddin's arms and legs used to handle.</p>


<p class="plain">But, this was not enough for young Tater.  He decided to test out the handy genes that had surely been handed
down from his father.  Thus came into being the interminable <b>Changing Table Fiasco</b>.</p>

<p class="plain">Armed with cursory plans from the internet and a full 90 seconds of 8<sup>th</sup> grade wood shop training, Tater began
constructing a cute little bit of furniture.  So, after 4 months of evenings and weekends, well-placed guidance from a Cousin/Craftsman
and much gnashing of teeth, our nursery is home to a brand new, handmade, pine combo-style changing table.  Whew!</p>
